# Weather_App

This is a weather demo App I made with SwiftUI, I used the CoreLocation to get the current location coordinates. 
The current weather is provided by OpenWeather , a free weather API.

# Improvements to do in future sprints 

- [x] ~~Change icons depending on the weather~~
- [x] ~~Hide coordinates~~
- [x] ~~Fix background image~~
