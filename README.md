# Weather_App

This is a weather demo App I made with SwiftUI, I used the CoreLocation to get the current location coordinates. 
The current weather is provided by OpenWeather , a free weather API.

# Improvements to do in future sprints 

- [x] Change icons depending on the weather 
- [x] Hide coordinates
- [ ] Fix background image
